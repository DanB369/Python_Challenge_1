# Python_Challenge_1

## This is Challenge 1 from Pyhton Module 2 

## I added several lines of code to update the existing menu. 

* I had to define when I wanted the While loops to break so that i could end the loops based on user input 

* Defined a list to append other variables to this allowed me to gather the totals of each at the end to display to the user

* Added error checks to the users input and print outputs to make the user aware of the error

* Print output came back out of sync with the other spacing / corrected this issue 

* Now users can complete the order / The loops end / and the system prints out what the user ordered back to them along with an item total. 

## Project complete until next iteration 06/17/24 DB
